            <p class="sectionSubTag textSmall">Students can fit them around their existing responsibilities and
                commitments, and can
                engage with multimedia content and
                learning materials at whatever time is most convenient to them. Even better: they don’t have to travel
                anywhere to
                study, they can simply log in to the virtual campus from the comfort of their own home or office.

                There’s a second reason why online learning has become so popular: it’s cheaper. Cost can often be a
                prohibitive factor
                in why individual students don’t enrol in courses they’re interested in. This is also an issue for
                corporations who wish
                to encourage their employees to undergo further training but don’t have much of a budget for conferences
                and
                training
                courses. Online courses are easily accessible on much smaller budgets.

                In addition to the convenience and the cost, a large number of students are turning to online learning
                courses because
                they have become a better way to learn. Those students who are serious about improving their
                understanding,
                learning new
                skills and gaining valuable qualifications are keen to enrol in the type of course that will be the most
                effective.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag textSmall">Even during the middle ages, education in India was imparted orally.
                Education was provided to the individuals free of
                cost. It was considered holy and honorable to do so. The ruling king did not provide any funds for
                education but it was
                the people belonging to the Hindu religion who donated for the preservation of the Hindu education. The
                centres of Hindu
                learning, which were the universities, were set up in places where the scholars resided. These places
                also became places
                of pilgrimage. So, more and more pilgrims funded these institutions.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag textSmall">The first millennium and the few centuries preceding it saw the
                flourishing of higher education at Nalanda, Takshashila
                University, Ujjain, & Vikramshila Universities. Amongst the subjects taught were Art, Architecture,
                Painting, Logic,
                mathematics, Grammar, Philosophy, Astronomy, Literature, Buddhism, Hinduism, Arthashastra (Economics &
                Politics), Law,
                and Medicine. Each university specialized in a particular field of study. Takshila specialized in the
                study of medicine,
                while Ujjain laid emphasis on astronomy. Nalanda, being the biggest centre, handled all branches of
                knowledge, and
                housed up to 10,000 students at its peak</p>
